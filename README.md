# Introduction
Hello everyone! welcome to the git! in order to get started, please follow the manual and install the stuff for the rasp pi pico 2 W, which can be found in the drive with the pico resources.

# Getting Started
Pull the project onto VS code. After pulling, restart VS Code in order for it to download all of the requirements. Then click on the litte raspberry pi pico logo on the left of your screen, then click "Configure CMake" and "Clean CMake" in that order, and it should get rid of any red squiggles you get. Sometimes, when making a new file, there will be error squiggles when importing, tbh im not sure why since it does not happen for me. If you can send me the error message maybe i can fix it.

# Future Proofing
Preferably, please write your part in a seperate file of the other groups in order to make pushing to the git less messy! But make sure it is easy to combine your part with the other parts in the later stages!

# General advice
Please DONT FORGET TO PUSH YOUR CHANGES. No need to push all the time, but when even a part of your program works correctly, push it. Preferably DONT PUSH broken code, but do what you want since git is for source control, and that is not my issue. If anything is wrong with the git spesifically, please talk to me - Pier
